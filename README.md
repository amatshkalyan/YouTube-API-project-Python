# YouTube API project via Python


**YouTube Data Generator**
In this Python code, I'm showing how to use the YouTube Data Generator script working for data enthusiasts for more advanced YouTube data! This Python code lets you fetch and analyze YouTube data using the YouTube API. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a content creator, or a researcher, this tool provides you with the capability to gather valuable insights from YouTube videos, channels, and playlists.

**Features**
**Video Data**: Retrieve detailed information about YouTube videos, including video titles, descriptions, view count, likes, dislikes, etc.
**Channel Data**: Access information about YouTube channels, such as channel name, description, subscriber count, and video uploads.
**Playlist Data**: Fetch data related to YouTube playlists, including playlist title, description, video count, and videos within the playlist.

### How to generate the YouTube API key

_Step 1: Create a Project on Google Cloud Platform_
Go to the Google Cloud Console:
Visit the Google Cloud Console.
Create a New Project:
Click on the project dropdown (usually located in the top left corner), then click on "New Project". Enter a name for your project and click "Create".

_Step 2: Enable the YouTube Data API v3_
Navigate to the API Library:
In the Google Cloud Console, go to the "API & Services" > "Library" section.
Find and Enable the YouTube Data API v3:
In the API Library, search for "YouTube Data API v3". Click on it, then click the "Enable" button.

_Step 3: Create Credentials (API Key)_
Go to the Credentials Page:
In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
Create Credentials:
Click on the "Create Credentials" dropdown and select "API Key". A dialog will appear showing your newly created API key.

_Step 4: Use Your API Key_
You can now use the generated API key to make requests to the YouTube Data API v3.
Please ensure to keep your API key confidential. Do not share it publicly or include it directly in client-side code. Instead, if you're building a web application, use a server-side component to make API requests with your API key to protect it.


### Build a Python script to generate desired YouTube data 

_Step 1: Generate API  then choose your desired YouTube channels for extracting data._
I'm using my favorite top 10 data analytics/data science channels to gather general data instantly using Python script.

_Step 2: Building Function to get channel statistics._
Then I'm building my preferred data frame using main columns from channel statistics and then building main views to analyse these channels.

##### Top Channels by Subscribers

##### Channels by Distribution of Views

##### Total uploaded videos by channel

_Step 3: Building Function to detailed video data for your chosen Channel._
I'm using Python script to generate the whole data for my favorite data analytics channel on YouTube and building views showing main insights for that channel

##### Top 10 videos for the channel of "Alex The Analyst"
<img width="984" alt="image" src="https://github.com/amatshkalyan/YouTube-API-project-Python/assets/149266119/7539e8b0-eb59-4d10-9c8c-5e164b6fefe7">

##### Number of uploaded videos over time by Month
<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/amatshkalyan/YouTube-API-project-Python/assets/149266119/0b154d63-8b89-4231-a087-01601085bb39">


Then continuing using this logic you can generate more playlist-related data, build other custom views, and analyze them using this Python script which will allow you to learn data analytics/data science staff from my preferred channels and build new skills in this area.

For more detailed information how I get this data find my Python script attached.
